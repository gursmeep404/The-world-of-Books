            <h2>The Book</h2>
            <p>This was the last book in the series. A story of 3 teenagers Jeremiah, Belly and Conrad who are so
                different from each other yet there's something commom between them. </p>
            <p>Something that connects them beyond their independent struggles of growing up. Something beyond their
                childish imfatuations, summer flings and goofey natures </p>
            <p>The beach</p>
            <p>It's like a separate world nobody else can touch. It's Beck and her boys, Laurel and her kids. A
                friendship written in the stars </p>
            <ul>
                <li>“My whole life was measured in summers.”</li>
                <li>"The air tasted just the same, smelled the same. Like it had been waiting for me to get here”</li>
                <li>"Would you rather live one perfect day over and over or live yoyr life with no perfect days but just
                    decent ones? "</li>
                <li>“So no, he didn't give me flowers or candy. He gave me the moons and the stars. Infinity”</li>
            </ul>
