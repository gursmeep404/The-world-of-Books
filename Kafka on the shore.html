            <h2>The Book</h2>
            <p>This is the strangest book I have read this summer. So many loose endings and mostly for the reader to
                interpret </p>
            <p> So many lives and so many perspectives. To be honest it was a little disturbing at times but a beautiful
                story it was </p>
            <p>Kafka Tamura's tale of finding himself. The parts I loved the most were the painting of kafka and the
                song kafka on the shore</p>

            <ul>
                <li>“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions”</li>
                <li>"What am I always so tensed about? Why this desperate struggle just to survive”</li>
                <li>"Silence I discover is something you can actually hear "</li>
                <li>“She gazes- At Kafka on the shore”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Reminders</h2>
            <p> I felt the complexity of human emotions. How we as people are terrorised by our very being </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Although that sounds dumb</li>
                <li>And words are futile devices</li>
