            <h2>The Book</h2>
            <p>Malala, I have grown up hearing her name and I know she got shot by a bullet but this is a strange world
                we live in and anything can happen here. So, I didn't think about it alot </p>
            <p> Reading her story got me thinking about how brave humans can be. A girl who got to speak at the United
                Nations and got a chance to change the world </p>
            <p>But maybe we all have that chance. We are choosing not to be there</p>

            <ul>
                <li>“At night our fear is strong . . . but in the morning, in the light, we find our courage again.”
                </li>
                <li>“Once I had asked God for one or two extra inches in height, but instead he made me as tall as the
                    sky, so high that I
                    could not measure myself.”</li>
                <li>“We have much more in common than we have different”</li>
                <li>“I am Malala, my world has changed but I have not”</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>The Reminders</h2>
            <p> I have realised how priviledged we are to be able to see, hear,smell, feel,think. I have known this but
                never appreciated it enough. It's a priviledge to be alive. I think there's more to life than earning
                money and having fun. This life is for others more than it is for us </p>

                <li>Pairon ki bediyan khuaabon ko baandhe nahi re</li>
                <li>Kabhi nahi re</li>
