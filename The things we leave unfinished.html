            <h2>The Book</h2>
            <p>Four generations, three romances, two endings and one story. But the story that I loved the most was
                about
                Scarlett and Jameson. </p>
            <p>Two people who met each other in the midst of World War II and lived half their life in letters. She was
                a
                section officer and he was a fighter pilot of the US army. </p>
            <p>It all starts in UK but ends in colorado but if you truly ask me, for me the story is stuck on the
                station
                where Scarlett and Jamesson met, on their first sunset date, their
                first dance and their letters to each other</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“Life is too short to miss the lightning strike and too long to live it alone.”</li>
                <li>“Sometimes I wonder if I just enjoy the beginnings, and that's why I never seem to
                    move past them. The
                    beginnings are
                    what make everything romantic.”</li>
                <li>“Perhaps the kindest thing I could do for the characters would be to leave their
                    stories unfinished.
                    Leave them with
                    their possibilities, their potential, even if they only exist in my own mind.”</li>
                <li>“Without the potential for disaster, would we ever really know what we have?”</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Reminders</h2>
            <p>Some books never really leave you. They stay with you like clouds in the sky</p>
            <p>And then there are days where the rain comes pouring down wetting you in its memories</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The kind of love that you only find once in a lifetime</li>
                <li>Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944, and you were headed off to fight in the war</li>
                <li>You still would have been mine</li>
                <li>We would have been timeless</li>
            </ol>
